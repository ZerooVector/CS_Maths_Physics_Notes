#RL  

- Supervised Learning  is a method of inductive learning, which approximates a function $h (x)$ to fit the real function $f(x)$ 
- By unsupervised learning, we find the model that **explains / represents** the data 
- RL is also called **Optimal Control, Approximate Dynamic Programming**
- RL is used to solve some **Sequential Decision Making Problems**, such as some problems in **Control Theory, Operations Research or Financial Engineering/Tech**

RL 有如下的特点：
- Stochastic Environment
- Incomplete Model （这与控制理论中的研究对象不同，我们没有对于环境的完全建模，系统需要作为一个观测器，通过数据估计系统的模型或参数）
- Interdependent sequence of decisions 
- No supervision 
- Partial and delayed feedback
