### Computational Swarm Intelligence
Intelligence is often considered a property of individuals, but individuals in a community can communication. Then, individuals in a community become to gain "Emergent behaviour".
So we try to develop distributed systems without central control, and we can use some algorithms to solve optimization problem.
E.g. Multi-Agent Sys., Ant Colony Opt., Particles Swarm Opt.

### Nouvelle AI （行为智能）
**Intelligence without Representation**
The basic building blocks of intelligence are very simple behaviours, More complex behaviours "emerge" from the interaction of these simple behaviours.

- **Situated AI（具身智能）** Build embodied intelligences situated in a real world (Nouvelle)
- **RL**
